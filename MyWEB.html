        <hr>
        <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small><br><br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other uses, see Universe (disambiguation).</i>
        <p>The <b>universe</b> (Latin:<i> universus</i>) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] including
            planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing
            cosmological description of the development of the universe. According to this theory, space and time
            emerged
            together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago,[11] and the universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang.
            While
            the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size of the observable
            universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.</p>

        <p>The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and
            were
            geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[12][13] Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations
            led
            Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In
            developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes
            Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further observational improvements led to the
            realization that the Sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few
            hundred billion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets. At the largest scale,
            galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an
            edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form
            immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[14] Discoveries in the early 20th
            century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then[15] at
            an increasing rate.[16]</p>
        <p>According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the
            universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32
            seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and
            continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually
            gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds
            of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the
            first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today</p>
        <p>From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter
            than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter
            is known as dark matter[17] (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it
            exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of the
            universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological
            constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is
            responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%±1.1% [2015] is dark matter.[18] Ordinary
            ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% [2015] of the physical universe.[18] Stars, planets, and
            visible gas clouds only form about 6% of the ordinary matter.[19]</p>
        <p>There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything,
            preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that
            information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse
            hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.[3][20][21]</p>

        <h1>Definition</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The physical universe is defined as all of space and time[a] (collectively referred to as spacetime) and
            their contents.[10] Such contents comprise all of energy in its various forms, including electromagnetic
            radiation and matter, and therefore planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic
            space.[22][23][24] The universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and matter, such as
            conservation laws, classical mechanics, and relativity.[25]</p>

        <p>The universe is often defined as "the totality of existence", or everything that exists, everything that has
            existed, and everything that will exist.[25] In fact, some philosophers and scientists support the inclusion
            of ideas and abstract concepts—such as mathematics and logic—in the definition of the universe.[27][28][29]
            The word universe may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos, the world, and nature.[30][31]</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Etymology</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The word universe derives from the Old French word univers, which in turn derives from the Latin word
            universum.[32] The Latin word was used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the
            modern English word is used.[33]</p>
        <h2>Synonyms</h2>
        <p>A term for universe among the ancient Greek philosophers from Pythagoras onwards was τὸ πᾶν (tò pân) 'the
            all', defined as all matter and all space, and τὸ ὅλον (tò hólon) 'all things', which did not necessarily
            include the void.[34][35] Another synonym was ὁ κόσμος (ho kósmos) meaning 'the world, the cosmos'.[36]
            Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (totum, mundus, natura)[37] and survive in modern languages, e.g.,
            the German words Das All, Weltall, and Natur for universe. The same synonyms are found in English, such as
            everything (as in the theory of everything), the cosmos (as in cosmology), the world (as in the many-worlds
            interpretation), and nature (as in natural laws or natural philosophy).[38]</p>

        <h1>Chronology and the Big Bang</h1>
        <hr>
        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Main articles: Big Bang and Chronology of the universe</i></small>
        <p>The prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the Big Bang theory.[39][40] The Big Bang model
            states that the earliest state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that the universe
            subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions
            such as the homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda)
            and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good
            account of various observations about the universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the
            correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and
            the microwave radiation background.</p>

        <P align="center" alt="" style="width:100%"><b>In this diagram, time passes from left to right, so at any given
                time, the universe is represented by a disk-shaped "slice" of the diagram</b></P>
        <p align="center">The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period extending from time
            zero to one
            Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types
            of energy were concentrated into a dense state, and gravity—currently the weakest by far of the four known
            forces—is believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been
            unified. Since the Planck epoch, space has been expanding to its present scale, with a very short but
            intense period of cosmic inflation believed to have occurred within the first 10−32 seconds.[41] This was a
            kind of expansion different from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not physically move;
            instead the metric that defines space itself changed. Although objects in spacetime cannot move faster than
            the speed of light, this limitation does not apply to the metric governing spacetime itself. This initial
            period of inflation is believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much larger than light
            could travel since the start of the universe.[clarification needed]</p>
